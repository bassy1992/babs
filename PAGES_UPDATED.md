## How to Test

### 1. Start Backend
```bash
cd back
python manage.py runserver
```

### 2. Start Frontend
```bash
cd front
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test Shop Page
1. Go to http://localhost:8080/shop
2. You should see 4 products loaded from database:
   - Noir Bouquet (Bestseller)
   - Rose Velours
   - Amber Dusk
   - Citrus Bloom
3. Try searching for "rose" - should filter results
4. Try sorting by price - should reorder products
5. Check browser Network tab - should see API calls

### 4. Test Homepage
1. Go to http://localhost:8080
2. Scroll to "Featured creations" section
3. Should see 4 products from database
4. Scroll to "Signature collections" section
5. Should see 3 collections from database
6. Check browser Network tab - should see API calls

## What's Working

### Shop Page
```
User visits /shop
    â†“
useProducts() hook fetches from API
    â†“
GET /api/products/
    â†“
Backend returns products from database
    â†“
Products displayed in grid
    â†“
User searches "rose"
    â†“
GET /api/products/?search=rose
    â†“
Filtered results displayed
```

### Homepage
```
User visits /
    â†“
useFeaturedProducts() fetches featured
useFeaturedCollections() fetches collections
    â†“
GET /api/products/featured/
GET /api/collections/featured/
    â†“
Backend returns data from database
    â†“
Featured products and collections displayed
```

## Remaining Pages to Update

- [ ] Product Detail (`/product/:slug`) - Use `useProduct(slug)`
- [ ] Collection Page (`/collection/:slug`) - Use `useCollection(slug)`
- [ ] Search Page (`/search`) - Use `useSearchProducts(query)`
- [ ] Order Confirmation (`/order/:id/confirmation`) - Use `api.orders.get(id)`

## Data Flow

### Before (Hardcoded)
```typescript
const PRODUCTS = [
  { id: "noir-bouquet", name: "Noir Bouquet", price: 89, ... }
];
```

### After (Dynamic from API)
```typescript
const { data, isLoading } = useProducts();
const products = data?.results.map(p => ({
  id: p.id,
  name: p.name,
  price: parseFloat(p.price),
  ...
}));
```

## API Response Format

### Products List
```json
{
  "count": 4,
  "next": null,
  "previous": null,
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "noir-bouquet",
      "name": "Noir Bouquet",
      "slug": "noir-bouquet",
      "price": "89.00",
      "image": "https://...",
      "badge": "Bestseller",
      "is_bestseller": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### Featured Products
```json
[
  {
    "id": "noir-bouquet",
    "name": "Noir Bouquet",
    "price": "89.00",
    "image": "https://...",
    "badge": "Bestseller"
  }
]
```

### Featured Collections
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Atelier Collection",
    "slug": "atelier-collection",
    "description": "Limited extrait editions...",
    "image": "https://...",
    "href": "/collection/atelier-collection",
    "is_featured": true
  }
]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Products Not Loading
1. Check backend is running: http://localhost:8000/api/products/
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Check Network tab for failed requests
4. Verify CORS is configured in backend

### Search Not Working
1. Type in search box
2. Check Network tab - should see `?search=` parameter
3. Backend filters products by name, description, story
4. Results update automatically

### Sort Not Working
1. Change sort dropdown
2. Check Network tab - should see `?ordering=` parameter
3. Backend sorts by price field
4. Results reorder automatically

## Performance Notes

- **React Query Caching**: Products are cached for 5 minutes
- **Automatic Refetching**: Data refetches on window focus
- **Loading States**: Spinners show while fetching
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error messages with retry

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Shop page loads from database
2. âœ… Homepage loads from database
3. ðŸ”„ Update Product Detail page
4. ðŸ”„ Update Collection page
5. ðŸ”„ Update Search page
6. ðŸ”„ Update Order Confirmation page

## Success! ðŸŽ‰

Both the Shop page and Homepage are now fully connected to the Django backend and loading data dynamically from the database!

**Test it now:**
1. Start both servers
2. Visit http://localhost:8080/shop
3. Visit http://localhost:8080
4. See real data from your database!
