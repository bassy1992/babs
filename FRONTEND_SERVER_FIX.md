# Frontend Server Error Fix

## Issue
```
GET http://localhost:8080/client/pages/Product.tsx?t=1761301877039 
net::ERR_ABORTED 500 (Internal Server Error)
```

## Cause
This error occurs when the Vite dev server encounters an issue with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) after file changes. The server is trying to reload the Product.tsx file but failing.

## Solution

### Quick Fix: Restart Frontend Server

**Stop the current server:**
- Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal running the frontend

**Start it again:**
```bash
cd front
npm run dev
```

### Alternative: Clear Cache and Restart

If restarting doesn't work:

```bash
cd front

# Clear node_modules cache
rm -rf node_modules/.vite

# Restart
npm run dev
```

### For Windows:
```cmd
cd front
rmdir /s /q node_modules\.vite
npm run dev
```

## After Restart

1. Visit: http://localhost:8080
2. Navigate to: http://localhost:8080/shop
3. Click on any product
4. Product detail page should load correctly

## About the Other Warnings

These warnings are **not errors** and can be ignored:

### 1. Meta Tag Deprecation
```
<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes"> is deprecated
```
- Just a deprecation notice
- Doesn't affect functionality
- Can be updated later in index.html

### 2. Apple Touch Icon
```
Error while trying to use the following icon from the Manifest
```
- Missing icon file
- Doesn't affect functionality
- Can add the icon later
