# Issue Fixed âœ…

## Problem
```
Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'RITUAL_STEPS' has already been declared
```

## Cause
The `RITUAL_STEPS` constant was accidentally declared twice in `front/client/pages/Index.tsx` during the refactoring.

## Solution
Removed the duplicate declaration. The file now has only one `RITUAL_STEPS` constant.

## Status
âœ… **Fixed** - No more syntax errors

## Other Warnings (Non-Critical)

### 1. Apple Mobile Web App Meta Tag
```
<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes"> is deprecated
```
**Impact:** Low - Just a deprecation warning, doesn't break functionality
**Fix (Optional):** Update to `<meta name="mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">`

### 2. Apple Touch Icon
```
Error while trying to use the following icon from the Manifest: 
http://localhost:8080/apple-touch-icon.png
```
**Impact:** Low - Icon file is missing, but app works fine
**Fix (Optional):** Add apple-touch-icon.png to public folder

## Test Now

The app should work perfectly now:

```bash
# Make sure both servers are running
cd back && python manage.py runserver
cd front && npm run dev
```

Then visit:
- **Shop:** http://localhost:8080/shop
- **Homepage:** http://localhost:8080

Both pages should load products from the database without any errors! ðŸŽ‰

## What's Working

âœ… Shop page loads all products from database
âœ… Homepage loads featured products and collections
âœ… Search functionality works
âœ… Sort functionality works
âœ… No syntax errors
âœ… No blocking errors

The warnings about meta tags and icons are cosmetic and don't affect functionality.
