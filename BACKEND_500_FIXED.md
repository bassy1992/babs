# Backend 500 Error Fixed ✅

## Issue
Getting 500 Internal Server Error when trying to load product details.

## Cause
The `ProductDetailSerializer` had a duplicate field issue:
- Had `variants` as a direct serializer field
- Also had `sizes` as a SerializerMethodField
- Both were trying to serialize the same data, causing conflicts

## Solution
Removed the duplicate `variants` field from the serializer. Now only uses `sizes` which is what the frontend expects.

## Fix Applied
Updated `back/products/serializers.py`:
- Removed: `variants = ProductVariantSerializer(many=True, read_only=True, source='variants')`
- Kept: `sizes = serializers.SerializerMethodField()` (which returns variants in the correct format)

## How to Apply

1. **Restart Backend Server:**
   ```bash
   # Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
   cd back
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

2. **Test the Fix:**
   - Go to: http://localhost:8080/product/noir-bouquet
   - Should load without 500 error
   - Product details should display correctly

## What to Ignore

The other warnings you see are not critical:

### Meta Tag Warning
```
<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes"> is deprecated
```
- **Impact:** None - just a deprecation notice
- **Action:** Can be ignored or updated later

### Apple Touch Icon Warning
```
Error while trying to use the following icon from the Manifest
```
- **Impact:** None - just a missing icon file
- **Action:** Can be ignored or add the icon file later
