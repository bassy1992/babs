# Product Page Fixed ✅

The Product Detail page now properly handles invalid product slugs and loads data from the database.

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Before
- Used hardcoded `PRODUCT_CATALOG` data
- Would show fallback product for any invalid slug
- Clicking on "jkhjkhjkhjkh" would show a product

### After
- ✅ Loads products from database via API
- ✅ Shows "Product Not Found" for invalid slugs
- ✅ Displays loading spinner while fetching
- ✅ Shows error message if product doesn't exist
- ✅ Provides navigation options (Browse All / Go Back)

## 🎯 New Behavior

### Valid Product Slug
```
User visits: /product/noir-bouquet
    ↓
API fetches product from database
    ↓
Product details displayed
```

### Invalid Product Slug
```
User visits: /product/jkhjkhjkhjkh
    ↓
API returns 404 error
    ↓
"Product Not Found" page displayed
    ↓
Options: Browse All Products or Go Back
```

## 📱 User Experience

### Loading State
- Spinner animation
- "Loading product..." message
- Clean, centered layout

### Error State
- Package icon with error styling
- "Product Not Found" heading
- Helpful error message
- Two action buttons:
  - "Browse All Products" → Go to /shop
  - "Go Back" → Return to previous page

### Success State
- Full product details
- Image gallery
- Size selection
- Add to cart
- Related products

## 🧪 Test It

### Test Invalid Slugs
1. Go to http://localhost:8080/product/invalid-slug
2. Should see "Product Not Found" page
3. Click "Browse All Products" → Goes to shop
4. Click "Go Back" → Returns to previous page

### Test Valid Slugs
1. Go to http://localhost:8080/product/noir-bouquet
2. Should see full product details

### Test From Shop
1. Go to http://localhost:8080/shop
2. Click on any product

4. Only valid products from database are shown

## 🔍 What Changed

### API Integration
- Uses `useProduct(slug)` hook
- Uses `useRelatedProducts(slug)` hook
- Fetches data from Django backend

### Error Handling
- Checks if product exists
- Shows loading state
- Shows error state
- Handles missing data gracefully

### Data Transformation
- Converts API response to frontend format
- Handles optional fields (rating, highlights, etc.)
- Parses price strings to numbers
- Maps related products

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Real-time product loading from database
- ✅ Proper 404 handling
- ✅ Loading states
- ✅ Error messages
- ✅ Navigation options
- ✅ Related products from API
- ✅ Null-safe rendering
- ✅ Type-safe data handling

## 🎉 Result

Now when you click on an invalid product slug like "jkhjkhjkhjkh", you'll see a proper "Product Not Found" page instead of showing a random product. Only products that actually exist in your database will be displayed!

**Test it:** http://localhost:8080/product/invalid-test-slug
